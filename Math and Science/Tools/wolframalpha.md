WolframAlpha

Comments: The fucking BEST. WolframAlpha is AMAZING and does SO MANY THINGS, it's also a lifesaver for any and all math problems you're stuck on so long as you're able to type the notation correctly for complex problems in Calc, DiffEq, etc. Purely delightful and has SO many tools for different areas.
